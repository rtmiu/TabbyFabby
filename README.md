# TabbyFabby

TabbyFabby (or Tabby, for short) is a Discord bot implemented on 
the JDA library and written in Kotlin.

## Use
To run Tabby, you need to pass it a Discord Bot User token as an argument.

```
# Assuming you have all dependencies bundled in a .jar
$ java -jar <jar_file> <app_bot_token>
  
# or if you have the token stored in a file
$ java -jar <jar_file> $(cat token_file)
```
